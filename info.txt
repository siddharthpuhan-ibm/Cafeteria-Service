python -m pip install fastapi uvicorn python-jose pytest
What these are for:
fastapi → backend framework
uvicorn → server to run FastAPI
python-jose → JWT tokens (mock auth later)
pytest → unit testing. (python -m pytest)


Typical Workflow

When you start a new feature, create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature-auth

Do work → commit → push:

git add .
git commit -m "Add mock auth"
git push origin feature-auth

When finished, merge after review:

git checkout main
git merge feature-auth
git push


check current branch: git branch
